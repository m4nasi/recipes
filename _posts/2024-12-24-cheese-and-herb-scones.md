**Cheese and Herb Scones** are fluffy, savory scones perfect for breakfast or as a snack with a cup of tea. The combination of cheese and fresh herbs creates a delightful flavour.

## Ingredients:
<ul class="ingredients-list">
<li class="ingredient">2 cups self-raising flour</li>
<li class="ingredient">1/2 cup grated cheese (cheddar or mozzarella)</li>
<li class="ingredient">2 tablespoons butter, cold and cubed</li>
<li class="ingredient">1/4 cup milk</li>
<li class="ingredient">1/4 cup water</li>
<li class="ingredient">1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped</li>
<li class="ingredient">1 teaspoon dried mixed herbs</li>
<li class="ingredient">1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li class="ingredient">1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
</ul>

## Instructions:
1. **Prepare the dough**:  
   - Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) and line a baking tray with parchment paper. In a large mixing bowl, combine the self-raising flour, grated cheese, mixed herbs, parsley, salt, and pepper. Add the cold butter and rub it into the flour using your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.

2. **Add liquids**:  
   - Gradually add the milk and water to the mixture, stirring until the dough just comes together. If the dough feels too dry, add a little more milk.

3. **Shape the scones**:  
   - Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead it a couple of times. Roll it out to about 2.5 cm (1 inch) thickness. Use a round cutter to cut out scones and place them on the prepared baking tray.

4. **Bake**:  
   - Bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown.

5. **Serve**:  
   - Let the scones cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy with butter or a dollop of cream!

Enjoy your **Cheese and Herb Scones**!
