**Lemon Drizzle Cake** is a light and zesty cake with a tangy lemon glaze. It’s a simple, refreshing treat that can be made for any occasion.

## Ingredients:
<ul class="ingredients-list">
<li class="ingredient">1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li class="ingredient">1 cup sugar</li>
<li class="ingredient">1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
<li class="ingredient">2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
<li class="ingredient">Zest of 1 lemon</li>
<li class="ingredient">1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li class="ingredient">1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li class="ingredient">1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li class="ingredient">2/3 cup milk</li>
<li class="ingredient">1/2 cup powdered sugar (for drizzle)</li>
<li class="ingredient">1 tablespoon lemon juice (for drizzle)</li>
</ul>

## Instructions:
1. **Prepare the cake batter**:  
   - Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) and grease and flour a loaf pan. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the lemon juice, zest, and milk, mixing well.

2. **Add dry ingredients**:  
   - Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into the wet ingredients. Mix until just combined.

3. **Bake**:  
   - Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center.

4. **Make the drizzle**:  
   - While the cake is baking, prepare the drizzle by mixing the powdered sugar with lemon juice. Adjust the consistency by adding a little more juice if needed.

5. **Finish the cake**:  
   - Once the cake is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for 5 minutes. While it’s still warm, drizzle the lemon glaze over the top of the cake.

6. **Serve**:  
   - Let the cake cool completely before slicing and serving.

Enjoy your **Lemon Drizzle Cake**!
