## Instructions:
Prepare Chickpeas:
1. If using dried chickpeas, soak them overnight in water. The next day, rinse them and cook in a pressure cooker with 4 cups of water, a pinch of baking soda, and a bit of salt for about 30-40 minutes, or until soft.
2. If using canned chickpeas, simply rinse and drain them.
Cook the Spices:
1. Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and bay leaf, and let them splutter.
2. Add chopped onions and saut√© until golden brown.
3. Add grated ginger, minced garlic, and chopped green chilies. Cook for 2 minutes.
Make the Gravy:
1. Add pureed tomatoes to the pan, along with coriander powder, cumin powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, red chili powder, and salt.
2. Stir well and cook the mixture until the oil separates from the masala (about 5 minutes).
Add Chickpeas:
1. Add the cooked chickpeas to the pan along with a cup of water (or more, depending on the consistency you prefer). Stir everything together, and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes.
Final Touches:
1. Adjust the seasoning with amchur or lemon juice to add tanginess.
2. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and serve hot with rice, naan, or roti.
